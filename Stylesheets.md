# Stylesheets

Create a file called `style.css` next to `x64dbg.exe` and it will use this style sheet on startup with `QApplication::setStyleSheet()`.

Please add your style sheets (gist+screenshot) here and don't forget to say which [color scheme](https://github.com/x64dbg/x64dbg/wiki/Color-Schemes) you used.
